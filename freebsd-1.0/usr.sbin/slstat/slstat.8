.SH NAME
slstat \- report serial line IP statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
slstat  [ \-i interval ] [ \-v ] [ \-r ] [ unit ] [ system ] [ core ]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Slstat
reports certain kernel statistics kept about serial line internet
protocol traffic.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-i
Repeat the display indefinitely every
.I interval
seconds.
If no
.I interval
is specified, the default is 5 seconds.
.TP
\-v
Verbose display of extra fields of information.
.TP
\-r
Display all values in rate per second that ammount per interval.
.TP
unit
is a single digit specifying the slip interface. The default unit is
.I 0
for interface
.I sl0.
.TP
system
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default, /386bsd.
.TP
core
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
core instead of the default, /dev/kmem.
.PP
By default,
.I vmstat
displays the following information:
.PP
.TP
in
bytes received
.TP
out
bytes sent
.TP
pack
packets received or sent
.TP
comp
compressed packets received or sent
.TP
uncomp
uncompressed packets received or sent
.TP
unknwn
inbound packets of unknown type
.TP
toss
inbound packets tossed because of error
.TP
other
all other inbound or outbound ip packets
.TP
err
input or output errors
.TP
search
searches for connection state
.TP
miss
times we could not find a connectoin state
.TP
coll
collisions with end of clists.
If you get many collisions (more than one or two
a day) you probably do not have enough clists
and you should increase "nclist" in param.c.
.SH EXAMPLES
The command ``slstat -i 5'' will print what the system is doing every five
seconds.
.SH FILES
