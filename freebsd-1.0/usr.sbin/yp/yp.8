.Sh NAME
.Nm yp
.Nd description of the YP system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm yp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm YP
subsystem allows network management of passwd and group file
entries through the functions getpwent(3) and getgrent(3).
The
.Nm YP 
subsystem is started automatically in
.Nm /etc/netstart
if the directory
.Nm /var/yp
exists.
.Sh BUGS
Only
.Nm YP
client functionality exists -- the server code has not yet been
written. Brave folk can contact the author.

.Nm /etc/passwd
and
.Nm /etc/group only supports "+" entries.

Many more manual pages should be written, especially ypclnt(3).
For the time being, seek out a local Sun machine and read the
manuals for there.

Neither Sun nor this author have found a clean way to handle
the problems that occur when ypbind cannot find its server
upon bootup.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm YP
subsystem was written from the ground up by Theo de Raadt
to be compatible to Sun's implimentation. No Sun code was
referenced.
