.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to read config files with the following syntax:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Lines starting in
.Sq #
are comments.
.It
An entry starts with the first 
.Sq !isspace()
character found.
.It
If continuation-lines are enabled, an entry ends before the first
empty line or before the first line not starting in an
.Sq isspace()
character, whichever comes first.
.It
Otherwise, an entry ends at the first
.Sq Li \en
.Li .
.El
.Pp
.Fn config_open
will open the specified
.Fa filename
and read it into a private malloced area, and close the file again. If
.Fa contlines
is non-zero, continuation lines will be allowed.
In case of trouble, the name of the system-call causing the trouble will
be returned. If successful,
.Fn config_open
returns NULL.
.Pp
.Fn config_close
will free the malloced area.
.Pp
.Fn config_next
returns the next entry in the area. NULL is returned to indicate End-of-file.
The returned string is null-terminated, and
.Sq \en
characters (if continuation lines are enabled) are converted to
space characters.
.Pp
.Fn config_skip
returns the next word from the string
.Fa *string
.Li .
.Fa *string
will be advanced to point to the next word.
NULL is returned to indicate the end of the string.
