.Sh NAME
.Nm setregid
.Nd set real and effective group ID
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn setregid "int rgid" "int egid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NB: In
.Fx 1.0.2
and earlier versions, this function would set the real and effective
group ID's of the current process according to the arguments.  In
.Fx 1.1 ,
we have adopted the behavior of
.Bx 4.4 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
function is normally used by programs which wish to temporarily
renounce special privileges they have gained (usually as a result of
being set-gid executables), by swapping real and effective
group ID's, so that the renunciation is reversible.
This can result in a security hole, and does not integrate well with
the
.Tn POSIX
saved group ID.  In
.Fx 1.1 ,
the
.Nm
function will never actually set the real group ID; however, it will
check its value to ensure that a future
.Xr setegid 2
call with the
.Fa rgid
argument will succeed.
.Pp
If
.Fa rgid
or 
.Fa egid
is -1, the current ID is filled in by the system.
The effective group ID is set, if requested, as if
.Xr setegid 2
had been called.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width [EPERM]
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and a change
other than changing the effective group-id to the real group-id
was specified.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
