.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn setuid
function
.Pq Fn setgid
sets the real, effective, and saved
user IDs (group IDs) of the current process
as specified.
.Pp
The

function
.Pq Fn setegid
sets the effective user ID (group ID) of the

.\" The
.\" .Fn setruid
.\" function
.\" .Pq Fn setrgid
.\" sets the real user ID (group ID) of the
.\" current process.
.Pp
When any of these calls succeed, the
.Dv SUGID
process flag is turned on, and remains on until the process calls
.Xr execve 2 ;
this flag can be inspected with
.Xr ps 1 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon success, these functions return 0;
otherwise \-1 is returned.
.Pp
If the user is not the super user, and the ID specified is not the
current real ID, the
.Nm setuid
and
.Nm setgid
functions return \-1.
.Pp
If the user is not the super user, and the ID specfied is not the
current real ID, the
.\" nor the saved ID, the
.\" should this really be true that setuid(geteuid()) is not allowed?
.Nm seteuid
and
.Nm setegid
functions return \-1.
