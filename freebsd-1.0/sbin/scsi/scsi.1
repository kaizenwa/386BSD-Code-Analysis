.Sh NAME
.Nm scsi
.Nd simple program to assist with scsi devices.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
usage: scsi -f devicename [-d level] [-i] [-r [-b bus] [-t targ] [-l lun]]
.Pp
where r = reprobe, i = inquire, d = debug
.Pp
If debugging is not compiled in the kernel, 'd' will have no effect
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm Scsi
program is used to give some simple commands to a scsi device. It is also
really a sample usage of the general scsi commands. A more comprehensive
program should be written.
.Pp
This program allows the operator to ask the systen to reprobe for
more devices, and also to set any debug level on any scsi device. As
a sample of a generic scsi command, it also can also perform a scsi 
.Em Enquiry
command against the device against which it is openned. The
reprobe can be aimed at any specific bus or target or even lun.
By default it reprobes lun0 of all possible targets not yet taken.
an lun of -1 will force testing of all LUNs. As a word of warning, this
will override the system's caution about attaching devices not on lun0
so if a device responds to the 
.Em inquiry
command on all luns (as many erroneously do), the system may think it has
found a lot more devices, which are really just the bad luns of an existing
device.
