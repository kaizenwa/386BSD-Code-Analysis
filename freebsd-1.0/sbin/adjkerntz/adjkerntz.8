.Sh NAME
.Nm adjkerntz
.Nd "adjusts the kernel time if the machine runs wall CMOS clock"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm adjkerntz
.Fl i
.Op Fl v
.Nm adjkerntz
.Fl a
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Adjkerntz
fixes kernel time (makes it UTC) using the current wall CMOS clock value,
the current time zone rule and the kernel timezone value. The adjustment is
enabled only if the file
.Pa /etc/wall_cmos_clock
exists, in other cases it is assumed that the machine runs UTC CMOS clock and
.Nm adjkerntz
does nothing.
.Pp
The adjustment is needed at boot stage and when a time zone
change occurs, so
.Nm adjkerntz
can be called in two forms:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Cm Fl i
initialization call from
.Pa /etc/rc
(before any daemons are started).
.Nm Adjkerntz
makes the first adjustment and the initial time zone offset is stored into
.Pa /var/run/.adjkerntz
for following subsequent
.Nm adjkerntz
calls.
.It Cm Fl a
This form is needed, when time zone changes occur.
.Nm Adjkerntz
uses the previously stored
time zone offset and the changed time zone rule to
produce the new time zone offset, fix the kernel time and store the new
offset into
.Pa /var/run/.adjkerntz
too.
It is recommended to use this form in root's
.Xr crontab 5
near 3am,
since this time matches most modern time zone changes.
.It Cm Fl v
This option is for diagnostic purposes. It causes
.Nm adjkerntz
to print differences between the old and new time zone offsets
to stdout.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Adjkerntz
clears the kernel timezone structure and makes kernel always run at UTC
time zone.
Super-user privilege is required for all operations.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ev TZ
Time zone change rule, see
.Xr tzset 3 ;
not needed when
.Xr zic 8
is used.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/wall_cmos_clock -compact
.It Pa /etc/localtime
Link to the current zone info file, see
.Xr zic 8 .
.It Pa /etc/wall_cmos_clock
Empty file.
Presence of it indicates that the machine runs wall CMOS clock,
absence indicates UTC CMOS clock.
.It Pa /var/run/.adjkerntz
Text file with the stored current time zone offset in seconds.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tzset 3 ,
.Xr zic 8 ,
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr crontab 5
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
No diagnostics, unless \-v option is specified.
If any error occurs, an error message printed to stderr and
.Nm adjkerntz
exits with return code greater than zero.
