.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm chkconfig
program is used to set and inquire the state of the system
configuration files.  These files are used by the system startup
scripts
.Pa /etc/rc ,
.Pa /etc/netstart ,
and
.Pa /etc/rc.local
to determine which programs and services to start when the system
boots.  The configuration files are normally located in the directory
.Pa /etc/config ,
but an alternate location can be specified with the
.Fl d
flag.
By convention, configuration file names do not contain dots (which are
reserved for files containing command-line options for various
programs), but this is not strictly enforced.
.Pp
There are four forms of the
.Nm chkconfig
command.  The first form, with no
.Ar option
argument, lists the state of the entire set of options.  If the
.Fl s
flag is specified, the files are first sorted according to the state
of each option; by default, they are sorted in ASCII collation order.
If there is a
.Pa .flags
file with the same basename as an option file, the flags listed therein are
also printed.
.Pp
The second form, with only a
.Ar option
argument (and no state) specified, retrieves the current value of the
specified option.  If the appropriate file exists and contains only
the word ``on'', then the option is considered to be on; otherwise it
is considered to be off.  Comments are allowed, using the `#'
character, but must begin in the first column of the file.
If the
.Fl v
flag is specified,
.Nm chkconfig
displays the status on the standard output.  In either case,
.Nm chkconfig
exits with a status of zero (true) if the option is on, or 1 (false)
otherwise.
.Pp
The third form, with the
.Fl o
flag specified, does not actually have anything to do with options,
but was included in
.Nm chkconfig
for convenience.  It looks in the configuration directory for a file
named
.Ar option Ns No .flags ,
and skips any comment lines, then prints the next line on the standard
output.
.Pp
The fourth form, with both
.Ar option
and
.Ar state
specified, attempts to change the state of
.Ar option
to be
.Ar state ,
which is interpreted in the same way as the file contents (above).  If
the configuration file does not already exist, the
.Fl f
flag must be specified to force creation of a new file.  If the
.Fl v
flag is specified,
.Nm chkconfig
displays the new status on the standard output if successful.
If unsuccessful,
.Nm chkconfig
displays an error message and exits with a non-zero return value.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl f
option is bogus, and kept only for SGI compatibility.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm chkconfig
command is modeled after the command of the same name in Silicon
Graphics' IRIX.  The
.Fl d
and
.Fl o
flags are extensions to the SGI version, as is the ability to have
comments in the configuration files.
