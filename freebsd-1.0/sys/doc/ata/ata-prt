                                draft proposal

                             ATA (AT Attachment) 

                          Rev 2.1     June 11, 1990

ABSTRACT:  This standard defines mechanical, electrical, and functional 
requirements for attaching small computers employing an AT Bus with 
intelligent peripheral devices. The resulting interface provides a common 
interface specification for systems manufacturers, system integrators, 
controller manufacturers, and suppliers of intelligent disk drives. 


CAUTION:  This is a preliminary draft of the proposed standard.  It is subject 
to change without notice, at the sole discretion of the CAM Committee.  It is 
likely that some sections may change significantly, and most sections will 
change to some extent in the course of further development of this draft 
standard.  This draft is distributed solely for the purpose of review and 
comment, and it should not be used as a design document without assuming the 
risk of an early implementation. 

COPYRIGHT NOTICE:  This draft standard is based upon product specifications of 
contributing members, these documents may be copyrighted by the individual 
companies. This draft standard may be reproduced without further permission, 
for the purpose of review and comment or for the purpose of including in an 
appropriate product specification provided the risk of early implementation is

If changes from the prior revision of this document are included, they may 
be identified by:

 - change bars at the side of each paragraph or 
 - printed in bold or
 - printed in italics or 
 - underscored in the text. 

The specific technique used will depend on the software used to detect the 
differences and the printer used to print the document. 

In the event that deleted text is identified by an overstrike, the Table of 
Contents will not be accurate. 

An electronic copy of this document is available from the CAM Committee 
(408-867-6630). 

This document has been prepared according to the style guide of the ISO 
(International Organization of Standards). 


If this document was printed in a 2-up form directly from the printer, NOTEs 
had to be adjusted to fit into a half-page, which may have resulted in an 
imperfect representation of the format within the NOTE. This is most likely 
to occur if a series of NOTEs are mixed in without any line separation.
