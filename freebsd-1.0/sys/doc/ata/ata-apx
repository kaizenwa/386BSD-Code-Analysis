Annex A: Diagnostic and Reset Considerations 
         (informative). 

This annex describes the following timing relationships during:

 a) Power On and Hardware Resets 
    - One drive 
    - Two drives 
 b) Software Reset 
    - One drive 
    - Two drives 
 c) Diagnostic Command Execution 
    - One drive 
    - Two drives 
    - Two drives - Drive1 failed 

The timing assumes the following: 

 o DASP- is asserted by Drive1 and received by Drive0 at power-on or 
   hardware reset to indicate the presence of Drive1. At all other times it 
   is asserted by Drive0 and Drive1 to indicate when a drive is active. 
 o PDIAG- is asserted by Drive1 and detected by Drive0. It is used by 
   Drive1 to indicate to Drive0 that it has completed diagnostics and is 
   ready to accept commands from the Host (BSY bit is cleared). This does not 
   indicate that the drive is ready, only that it can accept commands. This 
   line may remain asserted until the next reset occurs or an Execute 
   Diagnostic command is received. 
 o Unless indicated otherwise, all times are relative to the event that 
   triggers the operation (RESET-, SRST=1, Execute Diagnostic Command).

  NOTE: The 6 seconds referenced above is a host-oriented value. 

Annex B: Diagnostic and Reset Considerations  
         (informative). 

B.1  Power on and hardware reset (RESET-) 

DASP- is read by Drive0 to determine if Drive1 is present. If Drive1 is 
present Drive0 will read PDIAG- to determine when it is valid to clear BSY 
and whether Drive1 has powered on or reset without error, otherwise Drive0 
clears BSY whenever it is ready to accept commands. Drive 0 may assert DASP- 
to indicate drive activity.

B.2  Software reset 

If Drive1 is present Drive0 will read PDIAG- to determine when it is valid 
to clear BSY and whether Drive1 has reset without any errors, otherwise 
Drive 0 will simply reset and clear BSY.  DASP- is asserted by Drive0 (and 
Drive1 if it is present) in order to indicate drive active. 

B.3  DriveDiagnostic Command 

If Drive1 is present, Drive0 will read PDIAG- to determine when it is valid 
to clear BSY and if Drive1 passed or failed the Execute DriveDiagnostic 
command, otherwise Drive0 will simply execute its diagnostics and then clear 
BSY.  DASP- is asserted by Drive0 (and Drive1 if it is present) in order to 
indicate the drive is active. 

B.4  Truth Table 

In all the above cases:  Power on, RESET-, software reset, and the Execute 
DriveDiagnostics command the Drive0 Error Register is calculated as follows: 

        Drive1           PDIAG-         Drive0         Error 
        Present?        Asserted?        Passed        Register 

          Yes             Yes             Yes           01h 
          Yes             Yes              No           0xh 
          Yes              No             Yes           81h 
          Yes              No              No           8xh 
           No           (not read)        Yes           01h 
           No           (not read)         No           0xh 

Where x indicates the appropriate Diagnostic Code for the Power on, RESET-, 
software reset, or drivediagnostics error. 

B.5  Power On or Hardware Reset Algorithm

            all the other status bits) 
         c) Set the Drive1 Status Register to 80h (set BSY and clear all 
            the other status bits) 
 3) Read the single Drive0/Drive1 jumper and note its state
