1. add support for "soft" configuration network devices
2. split console driver into kbd/vga/other drivers
3. implement additional link layer support items (bpf et al)
4. fd.c: other floppy types, type detection, optional partitions, QIC40/80
5. fd.c: missing controller queue, no unit start, abysmal
6. kbd needs to turn scancodes into keyindexs with state map, then look
   through multinational scan map for foreign keyboards.
7. the return value for the xxxattach driver routines should be checked
   in isa.c.
8. For the Toshiba 1 network card, the init code fails. Needs to be
   fixed, if someone uses this card.
