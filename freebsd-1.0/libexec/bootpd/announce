Subject: RFC-1048 compatible BOOTP server now available


An RFC-1048 (BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions) compatible BOOTP (RFC-951)
server is now available for anonymous FTP from lancaster.andrew.cmu.edu
(128.2.13.21).  The new server can be found in pub/bootp.2.0.tar.  This is
an enhanced version of the existing CMU BOOTP server which was derived from
the original BOOTP server created by Bill Croft at Stanford.

New features and changes in version 2.0 include:

o  Full support for the vendor information extensions described in RFC-1048.
o  Faster response time (host lookup via hash table instead of linear search).
o  New termcap-like configuration file format which allows greater flexibility
   in specifying the variable vendor information of RFC-1048.  Host entries
   may refer to other hosts as templates so that redundant information need
   be specified only once.
o  Continued support for the CMU vendor information format.  The server may
   be configured on a per-host basis to always reply with a certain vendor
   information format or to reply based on the client's request.
o  Expanded logging.
o  The server may now be run by inetd or as a standalone program like the
   old version.
o  The configuration and debugging dump files may be specified on the command
   line.


The server has been successfully tested on the following machines:

    IBM RT PC running ACIS 4.3 (4.3 BSD)
    Sun 3/50 running SunOS 3.5
    DEC MicroVAX II running Ultrix 1.1
    DEC MicroVAX II running Ultrix 2.2
