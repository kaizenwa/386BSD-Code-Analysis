Subject: Updated RFC1048 BOOTP server now available

Well, no surprise, bootpd 2.0 had a few bugs.  A new improved version,
bootpd 2.1, is now available for anonymous FTP from lancaster.andrew.cmu.edu
(128.2.13.21).  The new server can be found in pub/bootp.2.1.tar.

Bug fixes and improvements in version 2.1 include:

o  The definition of "access to the bootfile" has been changed to require the
   public read access bit to be set.  This is required by tftpd(8), so the
   server will not reply with a file which a client cannot obtain via TFTP.
o  The RFC1084 bootfile size tag has been implemented.  It allows either
   automatic or manual specification of the bootfile size in 512-octet blocks.
o  Generic tags now work as advertised.
o  A subtle bug which caused strange parsing behavior under certain conditions
   has been fixed.
o  The RFC1048 vendor information now has the correct byte order on
   little-endien machines such as the VAX.
o  Failure to specify the bootfile home directory and/or default bootfile in
   the configuration file no longer causes server crashes.  The server now
   makes a reasonably intelligent choice if this configuration information is
   missing.  This is documented in the man page.
o  BOOTP requests from clients which already know their IP addresses no longer
   cause server crashes.
