It think it probably is.  I am told the line is 89% utilized.  But the throughpu
t
is shared, so I wouldn't worry about it.

Thanks.  Is it reasonable for people to ask for the 600KB f2c source over
uunet's dedicated line?    I'm just trying to find out if there's a problem
before there's a disaster.

Inet has no dialers.  All its calls go through the internet.  The mcsun addresse
s
were uunet.uu.net!mcsun!..., which will travel to uunet via Internet and
then across the ocean on uunet's dedicated line.
