.SH NAME
S/key \-  A proceedure to use one time passwords for accessing computer systems.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I S/key
is a proceedure for using one time password to authenticate access to
compter systems. It uses 64 bits of information transformed by the
MD4 algorithm. The user supplies the 64 bits in the form of 6 English
words that are generated by a secure computer.
Example use of the S/key program 
.I key
.sp
  Usage example:
.sp 0
 	>key  99 th91334
.sp 0
 	Enter password: <your secret password is intered here>
.sp 0
 	OMEN US HORN OMIT BACK AHOY
.sp 0
 	>
.sp
The programs that are part of the S/Key system are keyinit, key, and
keyinfo. Keyinit is used to get your ID set up, key is
used to get the one time password each time,
keyinfo is used to extract information from the S/Key database.
.sp
When you run "keyinit" you inform the system of your
secret password.  Running "key" then generates the
one-time passwords, and also requires your secret
password.  If however, you misspell your password
while running "key", you will get a list of passwords
that will not work, and no indication about the problem.
.sp
Password sequence numbers count backward from 99.  If you
don't know this, the syntax for "key" will be confusing.
.sp
You can enter the passwords using small letters, even
though the "key" program gives them in caps.
.sp
Macintosh and a general purpose PC use
are available. 
.sp
Under FreeBSD, you can control, with /etc/skey.access, from which
hosts and/or networks the use of S/Key passwords is obligated.
