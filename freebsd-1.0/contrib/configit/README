This is the README file for ConfigIt!, a kernel configuration file generator
for FreeBSD 1.1Beta and above.  ConfigIt! is a menu driven program that
askes what options and devices you want in your kernel.  For more information
on what the various options and devices are please see the file options.texi
in /sys/i386/doc.

To run ConfigIt! you must have Perl 4.036 (It has not been tested with Perl 5).

Steps needed to run ConfigIt!:
1. Make sure that you have Perl installed on your system.
2. Untar the archive in the directory where you wish to run it.
3. Run the program.
4. Copy the resulting config file to /sys/i386/conf.
5. Run config SYSTEM_NAME.
6. Change directory to /sys/compile/SYSTEM_NAME.
7. Run make depend and then make in /sys/compile/SYSTEM_NAME.

And thats it!
