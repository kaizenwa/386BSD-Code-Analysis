				 AddIt	
			    Version 0.8-Beta


This is the README file for AddIt version 0.8Beta.  AddIt is a
perl script that is intended to make adding a user to the system simple
and easy.  Installation and use are very easy and directions follow.

1. Un-tar the distribution on your system. It must have its own directory
   due to other files it uses.
2. Use vi to edit the userids file if your planning on using the auto id
   option of the system.  Make the userid one lower than what you want
   to start at.
3. Edit AddIt itself to configure the following options for use with the
   system.

   A. $defgroupid: This is the default group id the system will use.
   B. $defusrdir: This is the default place for the system to create
      user directories and copy needed files.
   C. $usequota: Define this variable if you wish to use quotas on your
      system.  Make sure that you have a kernel that has this defined.
   D. $usemail: Define this variable if you wish to have a flyer 
      mailed to the user after account creation.
   E. $usedefshell: Define this to be the default shell on your system.
   F. $useforward: Define this variable if you wish to have .forward
      files created for use on the system.
   G. $protouser: Define this variable to be the proto user for use with
      quotas. 
   H. $mailfile: This is the file to mail to a new user when $usemail is
      defined.

5. Make sure that the default user directory ($defusrdir) exists.
6. Run AddIt.  The program will ask you questions about the user and
   automaticly create their directory, copy startup files and then 
   do other things depending on how you have the system configured.
