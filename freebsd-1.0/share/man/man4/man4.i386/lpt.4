Parallel port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
For interrupt-driven ports:
.Cd "device lpt0 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT1\&" tty irq 7 vector lptintr
.Cd "device lpt1 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT2\&" tty irq 7 vector lptintr
.Cd "device lpt2 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT3\&" tty irq 7 vector lptintr
.sp
For BIOS-probed ports:
.Cd "device lpt0 at isa? port? tty irq 7 vector lptintr"
.sp
For polled ports:
.Cd "device lpt0 at isa? port? tty"
.Cd "device lpt1 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT2\&" tty
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to parallel ports. 
.sp
The driver can be configured either to be either interrupt-driven, or 
to poll the printer.  Ports that are configured to be 
interrupt-driven can be switched to polled mode by using the
.Xr lptcontrol 1
command.
.sp
This driver replaces the functionality of the 
.Xr lpa 4
driver, which is now defunct.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lptcontrol 1
.Sh BUGS
There are lots of them, especially in cheap parallel port implementations.
.sp
It is only possible to open a lpt port when a printer is connected and
on-line, making it impossible to run 
.Xr lptcontrol 1 
when there is no printer connected.
.Pp
This driver could still stand a rewrite.
