[...] My plaintext input looks like: "pagenum multiword-phrase" where
the multiword phrase is atmost five words.  So [...], I'm doing two
columns in small type.

I got one of the programmers here to write me a tex macro for my
problem.  When it goes into production I'll mail you a few files: a
sample input, the gptx command, the output, and the tex macro.  If you
find these interesting you can ship them with future gptx releases.

Thanks a lot for gptx.  If you have a mailing list of loyal users,
you can add us to it :-)

That is a full set of a files for an example of "production use".  You
are welcome to post them, or use them as a sample supplied with the
gptx distribution, etc., with absolutely no restrictions on what
anyone does with this.  In case you do so, please acknowledge the
contribution of Rakesh Chauhan, rk@cmie.ernet.in, who is the author of
x.pl and header.tex.  [...]

As you can tell, I used it for a 100% realworld problem, and it
worked.  Thanks a million.  If you'd like, I can send you a hardcopy
of the full finished document (just send me your mailing address).  If
you would like to mention the name of this document when you use
these files as a demo, it is
