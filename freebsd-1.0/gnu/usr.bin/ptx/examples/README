Various examples of GNU ptx usages.
Francois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>, 1993.

This directory contains a few examples contributed by GNU ptx users.
Feel free to look at them for tricks or ideas.  When an example
requires many files, a subdirectory is used to hold them together.
I have not necessarily tested these examples recently, if at all.

If you have examples you would like to share, please submit them to
me.  You may also submit corrections to the examples given in this
directory, however, please write to the authors first, since they most
probably will like to have their say about their own contribution.

* include.pl: A Perl script studying system include files.

* luke/: A shell script permuting indices for man pages.  It contains
two examples of an .xx definition for *roff, one simple, one complex.

* latex/: A simple example of \xx definition for latex.

* ajay/: A more complex application of latex with ptx.
