This is an beta release of GNU ptx, a permuted index generator.  GNU
ptx can handle multiple input files at once, produce TeX compatible
output, or a readable KWIC (keywords in their context) without the
need of nroff.  This version does not handle huge input files, that
is, those which do not fit in memory all at once.

The command syntax is not the same as UNIX ptx: all given files are
input files, the results are produced on standard output by default.
GNU ptx manual is provided in Texinfo format.  Calling `ptx --help'
prints an option summary.  Please note that an overall renaming of all
options is foreseeable: GNU ptx specifications are not frozen yet.

See the file COPYING for copying conditions.

See the file THANKS for a list of contributors.
