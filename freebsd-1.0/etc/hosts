# According to RFC 1597, you can use the following IP networks for
# private nets which will never be connected to the Internet:
#
#        10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255
#        172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255
#        192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255
#
# In case you want to be able to connect to the Internet, you need
# real official assigned numbers.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not try
# to invent your own network numbers but instead get one from your
# network provider (if any) or from the Internet Registry (ftp to
# rs.internic.net, directory `/templates').
